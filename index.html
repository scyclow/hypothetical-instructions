Talk to alfie steiner. ask him legal questions. give him an instruction or two




We should have a few special dollars with the seed phrase of a wallet plotted on the back of them.

Should try to set the space up like an arts and crafts space, as much as possible

  tell people to draw on dollars to get a sense of how the pen will show up

Should solicit volunteers to run some of the operations

Defacing US currency is a federal crime, and may be punishable with up to six months imprisonment in addition to fines. Neither the Artist nor Plottables LLC condone defacing, mutilating, cutting, disfiguring, perforating, or otherwise damaging US currency.

By purchasing an Instruction token the collector implicitly assumes full legal responsibility for the defacement of currency in their possession, and agrees to hold the Artist nor Plottables LLC harmless from all claims, losses, liabilities, public prosecutions, and costs associated with this project.

All Instructions exist as a purely artistic exercise, and collectors are strictly discouraged from executing said Instructions using the following tools: Axidraw pen plotters, fine-point pens (ex. Micron, LePen, Stabilo), felt tip and highlighter pens (ex. Sharpie), scissors, or lighters. The token thumbnail represents a mere simulation of what such an execution may look like.

As a token of gratitude, each collector is entitled to a crisp US $1 bill per minted token when claimed in Marfa, TX from 11/11/22 - 11/13/22.
